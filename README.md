# This is a repository for studies

## Focus on exercises made by users on beecrowd / leetcode / GPT

## This is what I'm learning now:

- Algorithms complexity (Big O)
- Data Structure
- File / Directory readers and writers
- Graphs (new)

```bash
git clone "url"
cd JavaExercises
cd src
```

## Choose which file do you want to execute

```bash
javac <package>/<file>.java
java <package>.<file>
```
